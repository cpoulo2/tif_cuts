    <b>Methodology</b><br><br>
    <i>‚ÄúDollars Lost‚Äù</i> refers to the potential TIF surplus revenue that a ‚Äúno‚Äù vote would withhold from schools. It is calculated by multiplying Mayor Brandon Johnson‚Äôs historic TIF surplus‚Äîof which $552 million is allocated to CPS‚Äîby each school‚Äôs budget share (that school‚Äôs budget as a percentage of the total CPS budget for schools).<br><br>
    <i>‚ÄúPositions Cut‚Äù</i> refers to the potential mid-year cuts that a ‚Äúno‚Äù vote would make necessary to balance CPS‚Äôs budget. It is calculated by dividing school-level TIF surplus revenue by 100,000 (the average per-position dollar amount) and multiplying by 2. We multiply by 2 because it takes twice as many position cuts to achieve the savings of one. These calculations use the Chicago Board of Education‚Äôs budgeted $387 million in TIF surplus revenue as the basis for the cuts.<br><br>
    <b>Data sources</b><br><br>
    Fiscal year 2026 budget data was FOIA'd from Chicago Public Schools (CPS). Student counts and demographics are from CPS's Racial/Ethnic Report for school year 2025.
